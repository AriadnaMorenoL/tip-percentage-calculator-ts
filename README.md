# Tip Percentage Calculator App
![App Screenshot](./src/assets/tip-percentage-calcularor-img.png)


This app allows users to calculate the total price of products including different tip percentages. 

## Features

- **Product Price Calculation:** Enter the price of products and get the total amount including the tip.
- **Tip Percentage Options:** Choose from various tip percentages to see how they affect the total price.
- **Component-Based Design:** The app displays content across different components for a modular and maintainable structure.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript:** To add static type checking.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
- **useReducer:** To manage the application's state, replacing a previous custom hook.

## Learning Outcomes

Through developing this app, I:

- Learned to manage state using `useReducer` instead of a custom hook.
- Gained experience in displaying content across different React components.
- Improved my skills in TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
